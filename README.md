## RSA Encryption and Decryption
This is a simple RSA encryption and decryption tool created in Python. It uses socket programming to communicate with a server and perform RSA encryption and decryption

### Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Socket 
- matplotlib 
- threading
- math

***How to run***
1. Clone the repository https://github.com/ZiadSheriif/Cryptosystem-RSA.
2. Start the server by running server.py.
3. Start the client by running client.py.
4. Enter a message to encrypt on the client side.
5. The encrypted message will **be sent to the server**, which will decrypt it and return **the decrypted message to the client**.
